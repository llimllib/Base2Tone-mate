### Base2Tone mate-terminal themes

A simple script to generate base2tone themes for mate-terminal. Just grab the
script you want from `mate-theme-scripts` and run it.

In my experience, the mate shell will be buggy until you restart it, at which
point you should see your new terminal colors.

To generate them yourself, run `gen.sh`
